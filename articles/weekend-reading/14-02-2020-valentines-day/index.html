<p>Valentine&rsquo;s Day finds me sitting in a client&rsquo;s office, watching the rain hammering against the window, hoping it stops for long enough for me to make the forty-five minute walk back into town later.</p>

<p>This week&rsquo;s post is pretty code heavy. The web is changing (as usual) and lots of stuff is coming - or at least being discussed - that will help us produce better, more flexible designs on the web.</p>

<p>I love generative art, but it always makes me wish I had paid more attention in maths at school. This article by Tyler Hobbs melted my brain a bit, but was fascinating all the same. When I have time I&rsquo;d really love to give some generative art a go.</p>

<p>You can see more of Tyler&rsquo;s art on his site, where he also has a shop.</p>

<p>Lots of discussion about the future of CSS at the moment. First off, <a href="https://css-irl.info/do-we-need-css4/" >this article on CSS IRL</a> on whether or not there should be a CSS4. Michelle summarises the position succinctly.</p>

<p>Essentially, the argument against is that the term CSS4 is fairly meaningless except from a marketing point of view. The counterargument is that marketing is exactly what we need to push uptake of new features and convince businesses to invest in bringing their websites up to date.</p>

<p>Next up, some news about <strong>container queries</strong>! These are something the development community have been wanting for a long time, but from what I gather they are incredibly complex to implement, so movement from browsers has been seemingly slow.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t for lack of willing though. <a href="https://bkardell.com/" >Brian Kardell</a> explains, and simultaneously sheds some light into how difficult it is to get new ideas refined enough that they can be turned into a specification and implemented in browsers.</p>

<blockquote>

    <p>The Agile Manifesto is an immune response on the part of programmers to bad management. The document is an expression of trauma, and its intellectual descendants continue to carry this baggage.</p>

<p>Oof. That&rsquo;s quite an opener. Agile - for anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know - is a hugely influential software development methodology that has become almost ubiquitous since the Agile Manifesto was released almost 20 years ago.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in management and project organisation (and who isn&rsquo;t?), this is a fascinating examination of the origins of one of most popular methodologies around.</p>
