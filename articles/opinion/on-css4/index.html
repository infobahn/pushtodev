<p>Since I wrote about Michelle&rsquo;s article about CSS4 last Friday, Chris Coyier has posted another article, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css4-update/" target="_blank">which collates the majority of the discussion so far</a>.</p>

<p>A lot of people now chiming in on this one. The general feeling (which I share) seems to be that wrapping up a set of new CSS features under a version number would probably be beneficial to most people, but there&rsquo;s still a lot debate over exactly how best to implement it.</p>

<p>CSS3 and HTML5 worked really well - I was working for an agency at the time, and definitely noticed an uptick in clients including both in project briefs, which in turn meant learning the new features became a business priority, rather than something I had to fit into my spare time.</p>

<p>Natalya Shelburne <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4770#issuecomment-585326989" target="_blank">points out</a> that it can be difficult to keep up with when new CSS features are production-ready, and thus worth dedicating the time to learn them. This certainly happened to me with CSS Grid. I had read the odd post about it, but it wasn&rsquo;t until speaking to Michelle after her talk at Up Front Conf last year that it really hit home that Grid was something I could quite easily be using in production. Now I use it on pretty much every site I work on.</p>

<p>If grouping a set of features under a specific label can help developers, and agencies and clients realise that certain things are ready for use, that seems a worthwhile goal to me. However, as Rachel Andrew highlights, it&rsquo;s not always obvious what is ready. Support levels can vary wildly depending on the project, so it&rsquo;s not as easy as simply marking a certain feature production ready.</p>

<p>In some ways, it seems to me that a label like CSS4 might work better as an aspirational thing. If a specific set of features could be agreed on and a date set for them to reach a certain support level (i.e. supported in the latest versions of all browsers), this might work as a goal for browser vendors to work towards. However, as per Rachel&rsquo;s point, this still wouldn&rsquo;t make those features production ready across all browsers, and setting a target like this also raises the possibility that we don&rsquo;t meet it.</p>

<p>However, if we don&rsquo;t do that, in order to ensure everything under the CSS4 label has an acceptable level of support, we&rsquo;d have to choose features a few levels away from the cutting edge. In that case, if we&rsquo;re highlighting features that are old enough that most developers know about them already, are we defeating the purpose of the label in the first place?</p>
